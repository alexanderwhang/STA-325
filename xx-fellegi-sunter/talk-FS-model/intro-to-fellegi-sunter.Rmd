\section{Agenda}

## Agenda

**Today's goal:** Introduce the Fellegi-Sunter *model* of record linkage.

\pause

Focus on:

- Motivating example and some fundamental ideas.
\pause

- Databases, records and attributes.
- Pairwise record comparisons.
- Model parameters: $m$ and $u$ distributions, matching weights, and matching configuration matrix.

\pause

Afterwards:

- Model estimation and linkage rules.
- Sadinle (2017) and McVeigh (2020) go into more detail here.

## Agenda

**Outline:**

1. Newcombe et al. (1959): "Automatic Linkage of Vital Records"
    - Provides a motivating example and introduces key ideas.
2. Fellegi and Sunter (1969): "A Theory for Record Linkage"
    - I will focus on the record linkage *model* rather than the theory.
    - I will deviate a little bit from the original paper in order to introduce the key supplemental idea of ``Bayesian FS.''

## Newcombe's Automatic Linkage of Vital Records

## Newcombe's Automatic Linkage of Vital Records

\begin{exampleblock}{What they did:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduced an automatic (probabilistic) record linkage technique and implemented it on the Datatron 205 computer.
    \end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}

\pause

\textbf{Two things here:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stated record linkage as a statistical problem and proposed the first unsupervised probabilistic RL approach.
    \item They showed that a computer could be programed to perform RL.
\end{itemize}


## Newcombe's Automatic Linkage of Vital Records
    
\textbf{\alert{Their applied goal:}} to link \textbf{34,138 birth records} from 1955 in British Columbia \textbf{to 114,471 marriage records} in the preceding ten year period.

        Husband's family name & Ayad & Ayot \\
        Wife's family name & Barr & Barr\\
        Husband's initials & J Z & J Z\\
        Wife's initials & M T & B T\\
        Husband's birth province & AB & AB\\
        Wife's birth province & PE & PE\\
        \bottomrule

\end{table}


## Newcombe's Automatic Linkage of Vital Records

\begin{exampleblock}{Newcombe's algorithm:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Sort records by the Soundex coding of family names.
        \item Where Soundex coding agrees, and informal likelihood ratio test determines whether or not to link.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{exampleblock}

\pause

\textbf{Soundex coding:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Olivier $\longrightarrow$ O416
    
    \item Oliver $\longrightarrow$ O416
    
    \item Olivia $\longrightarrow$ O410
    
    \item Rebecca $\longrightarrow$ R120
    
    \item Rebbeka $\longrightarrow$ R120
    
    \item Beka $\longrightarrow$ B200
\end{itemize}


## Newcombe's Automatic Linkage of Vital Records
    
\textbf{Likelihood ratio test:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Imagine that two records agree on the husband's first initial J.
    \pause
    \item Let $p_L$ be the probability of this given that the records are actually a match, and let $p_F$ be the probability of this given that the records are not a match.
    \pause
    \item Let $p_R$ be the proportion of the initial ``J'' among husbands.
\end{itemize}
\pause
Then
$$p_L \approx p_R, \pause\quad p_F \approx p_R^2$$
\pause
so
$$
    \log(p_L/p_F) \approx -\log (p_R).
$$
\pause This is the ``matching weight.''

## Newcombe's Automatic Linkage of Vital Records
    
\textbf{Likelihood ratio test (cont'd):}

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the initial is very common, e.g. $p_R = 0.1$, then
    $$
        \log(p_L/p_F) \approx -\log(0.1) \approx 2.3
    $$
    is weights in a little bit for a match.
    \pause 
    \item If the initial is not at all common, e.g. $p_R = 0.0001$, then
    $$
        \log(p_L/p_F) \approx -\log(0.0001) \approx 9.2
    $$
    weights in much more in favor of a match.
\end{itemize}

## Newcombe's Automatic Linkage of Vital Records

\begin{exampleblock}{Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Processed 10 record pairs per minute.
    \item About $98.3\%$ of the true matches were detected, and about $0.7\%$ of the linked records were not actual matches.
    \item ``by far the largest part of the effort'' was the preparation of punched card files reproducing marriage records in an adequate format.
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}

\pause

\begin{alertblock}{Caveat:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Not clear how exactly the probabilities for the likelihood ratio test were computed in all cases.
    \end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}

\section{The Fellegi-Sunter model}

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

Fellegi and Sunter (1969). Published in JASA:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{FS}
\end{center}

## The Fellegi-Sunter model
\begin{exampleblock}{What this paper does:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It formalizes the approach of Newcombe et al. (1959) in a decision-theoretic framework.
    \end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}

\pause

Given a pair of records, it considers three possible actions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item to \textit{link} them;
    \item to call them a \textit{possible link}; or
    \item to \textit{not link} them.
\end{itemize}

An "optimal" decision rule is proposed for this.

\pause

Here I'm focusing on the model rather than the decision-theoretic framework.

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

**Basic elements:**

- Two *databases* $A$ and $B$
  - Duplication *accross* but not within databases (bipartite record linkage).
- *Records* with corresponding *attributes* or *fields*
  - Name, age, address, SSN, etc.

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

**What we want to do:**

- Figure out which records refer to the same **entity** (a *person*, *object* or *event*.)

\pause

**How we'll do that:**

- We'll compare records in pairs from databases $A$ and $B$, as to obtain multidimensional measures of similarity.
- Based on the measures of similarity, we'll try to group together the records which refer to the same entity.

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

Let $i = 1,2,\dots, N_1\times N_2$ enumerate the set of all record pairs in $A \times B$.
\pause

**Comparison vectors:**

- For the $i$th pair of records, we compute a corresponding *comparison vector*
$$
  \gamma_i = (\gamma_i^{(1)}, \gamma_i^{(2)}, \dots, \gamma_i^{(k)}).
$$
\pause

- Each $\gamma_i^{j}$ compares the $j$th field of the records.

\pause

- For example, if the $j$th field is "age," we could have $\gamma_i^{j} = 0$ if ages are the same, and $\gamma_i^{j} = 1$ if ages different.

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

**Binary comparisons:**

- $\gamma_i^{j} \in \{0,1\}$
\pause

**Levels of agreement/disagreement:**

- $\gamma_i^{j} \in \{0, 1, 2,\dots, L_j\}$
\pause

**How they're obtained:**

- You choose!
- Use string distance functions to compare names.

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

The set $\{\gamma_k\}_{j=1}^{N_1 \times N_2}$ of computed comparison vectors becomes the **observed data** for the Fellegi-Sunter model.
\pause

**Next component of the model:**

- The **matching configuration** $r = \{r_j\}_{j=1}^{N_1 \times N_2}$, with $r_j = 1$ if the $j$th record pair matches, and $r_j = 0$ otherwise.
  - This is the adjacency list representation. We can also use a matching configuration matrix.

- This is not a very efficient representation for bipartite matching. Saindle (2017) instead uses a *matching labeling*.

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

- For record pairs that are a ***m**atch* ($r_j = 1$), we assume that $\gamma \sim m$ independently.
\pause

- For record pairs that are ***u**nmatched* ($r_j = 0$), we assume that $\gamma \sim u$ independently.
\pause

- More precisely, 

$$
  p\left(\{\gamma_j\}_{j=1}^{N_1 \times N_2} \mid r, m, u\right) = \left(\prod_{j\,:\,r_j = 1} m(\gamma_j) \right)\times\left(\prod_{j\,:\,r_j = 0} u(\gamma_j) \right).
$$

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

$$
  p\left(\{\gamma_j\}_{j=1}^{N_1 \times N_2} \mid r, m, u\right) = \left(\prod_{j\,:\,r_j = 1} m(\gamma_j) \right)\times\left(\prod_{j\,:\,r_j = 0} u(\gamma_j) \right).
$$

\end{center}


## The Fellegi-Sunter model

What's left to do?
\pause

- Estimate model parameters.
\pause

- Define a prior $p(r, m, u)$.
\pause

- Obtain a posterior
\begin{align*}
  p(r \mid \{\gamma_j\}_{j=1}^{N_1 \times N_2}) &= \int p(r, m ,u \mid \{\gamma_j\}_{j=1}^{N_1 \times N_2})\,dm\, du\\
  &\propto \int p(\{\gamma_j\}_{j=1}^{N_1 \times N_2}\mid r, m, u)p(r, m, u)\,dm\, du
\end{align*}

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

- This is **not** what Fellegi-Sunter originally proposed
\pause

- Originally, FS proposed to estimate $m$ and $u$ on their own.
\pause

- Then, define the log-likelihood ratio (**matching weight**)
$$
  W(\gamma_j) = \log \frac{m(\gamma_j)}{u(\gamma_j)}.
$$
\pause

- Say that the $j$th pair is a match if $W(\gamma_j)$ is large, that they're not a match if $W(\gamma_j)$ is small: this is a likelihood ratio test.

## The Fellegi-Sunter model

What's the problem with the original FS approach?
\pause

- You consider all record pairs independently.
\pause

- You could link records $a$ and $b$, and $b$ and $c$, and yet say that $a$ and $c$ are not a match. This is incoherent.
\pause

- In the *bipartite record linkage* framework, we want to specify a prior on $r$ which reflects the fact that there is duplication across but not within databases.
